Heading What is Pathfinders?
Pathfinder is open for young people aged between 10-15 and is run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with clubs in many cities and regional centres around the world.
Pathfinders meet regularly with their local club, as well as travelling to meet with other pathfinders in regional, national and international events.
Pathfinders are involved in community service, fun group activities, camping and expeditions and a range of other activities.
There are honours on a range of subjects that can be earned and worn as part of the uniform, including everything from arts and crafts, to swimming and outdoor activities, to music, to computers, to model rocketry, and a lot of topics in between.
